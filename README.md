Investor Forecasting Simulation 

Investor Forecasting Simulation is a Python-based asset pricing simulation designed to explore how investors predict asset prices using various forecasting methods. This project specifically focuses on naive, adaptive, and trend-following techniques, illustrating their impact on market dynamics and investor behavior.

Overview

This simulation highlights three distinct investor forecasting strategies:

Naive Forecasting: Predicts future prices based on the most recent price observed.
Adaptive Forecasting: Forecasts dynamically adjust based on recent prices and previous predictions, controlled by a smoothing parameter (alpha).
Trend Forecasting: Projects future prices by identifying recent trends, guided by a trend parameter (beta).
This project provides insights into financial economics and asset pricing theory, suitable for economics, finance, and data-focused roles.

Features

Three distinct forecasting methods (Naive, Adaptive, Trend)
Adjustable forecasting parameters (alpha and beta)
Incorporation of stochastic noise for realism
Modular and extendable Python codebase
