Investor Forecasting Simulation

This Investor Forecasting Simulation is a Python-based asset pricing simulation designed to explore investor behavior through different forecasting strategies. The project simulates how investors predict asset prices using naive, adaptive, and trend-following methods, demonstrating their impact on market dynamics.

Overview

The simulation includes:

Naive Forecasting: Investors predict future prices equal to the most recent observed price.

Adaptive Forecasting: Predictions adjust dynamically, incorporating previous forecasts and recent prices with a parameter (alpha).

Trend Forecasting: Investors extrapolate recent trends into future prices using a parameter (beta).

This project is ideal for students or professionals interested in economics, finance, data analysis, and modeling investor behavior.

Features

Multiple forecasting methods (Naive, Adaptive, Trend)

Adjustable forecasting parameters (alpha and beta)

Realistic simulation using stochastic noise

Modular and extensible code design
